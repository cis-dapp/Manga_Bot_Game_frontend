Notes for Claude
Framework: React (with Vite or Next.js) is a good fit for modular components.
Assets: Put your manga characters and textures in public/assets/images.
Sound effects: Store .mp3 or .wav in public/assets/sounds and trigger via sound.js.
Disclaimer: Make it a persistent component styled like a manga narrator box.
Wallet integration: Use ethers.js or wagmi inside utils/wallet.js.
Psychological colors: Define them in styles/colors.css (e.g., --buy-green, --alert-red).
